# Machine Learning
The NXP eIQ Machine Learning Software Development Environment (hereinafter referred to as "NXP
eIQ") provides a set of libraries and development tools for machine learning applications targeting NXP
microcontrollers and application processors. The NXP eIQ is contained in the meta-imx/meta-ml Yocto layer.
See also the i.MX Yocto Project User's Guide (IMXLXYOCTOUG) for more information.
The following five inference engines are currently supported in the NXP eIQ software stack: TensorFlow Lite,
ONNX Runtime, PyTorch, DeepView RT, and OpenCV. The following figure shows the supported eIQ inference
engines across the computing units.
