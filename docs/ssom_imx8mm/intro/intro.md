SSOM-IMX8MM is an ultra-compact system module based on the NXP i.MX 8M Mini application processor. The module is equipped with LPDDR4 SDRAM, eMMC, NOR Flash, Power Management IC (PMIC), and three board-to-board connectors. Since most of the SoC (i.MX8M Plus) signals can be transmitted through the board-to-board connectors, the module supports the realization of the vast majority of the chip's functions. Its design is compatible with the NXP development kit (i.MX 8M Mini EVK), enabling the same functional features as the development kit and facilitating compatibility with software provided by NXPã€‚
