# Getting Started Guide

When you receive the SSOM-3588 core board and baseboard, we recommend that you first read our getting started guide to help you quickly get into the development phase.

Before you start using the SSOM-3588, you may need to prepare the following accessories:

- 12V/2A power adapter
- Network cable
- Type-C data cable
- Monitor supporting HDMI
- HDMI cable (Type-A connector)
- Keyboard and mouse
- MicroSD card and card reader (if using SD card boot)

If you do not need a graphical interface, you may only need the power adapter and Type-C data cable. You can connect the SSOM-3588 to your computer via network cable or Type-C data cable and operate the device through a terminal tool.

### 1.1 Micro SD Card

SSOM-3588 supports SD card boot and reserves a MicroSD card slot on the baseboard. If you want to use card boot, after following the steps to burn the system image below, you can directly insert the card into the Micro SD card slot on the SSOM-3588 baseboard.
We recommend that the Micro SD card is at least 32GB or larger.
