# Booting and Configuring the K1 Pro

### Boot Methods

The K1 Pro primarily uses SD cards and eMMC for booting.

- If an SD card with an image is present, it will boot from the SD card.
- If no image is present on the SD card but an image is present on the eMMC, it will boot from the eMMC.
- If neither the SD card nor the eMMC has an image, the system will not boot.

### Boot Notes

If the SD card or eMMC has a Linux system image burned onto it, the board will automatically run when powered on.

#### Boot Precautions:

1. Properly connect the peripherals on the board and secure them with the provided screws, especially for devices that do not support hot-swapping (e.g., MIPI displays, MIPI cameras, wireless modules, hard drives). Plugging or unplugging these devices while powered on may damage them and cause them to malfunction.

2. When using a display, note that the MIPI screen interface does not support hot-swapping. HDMI interfaces come in two forms: standard HDMI and Micro-HDMI. These two interfaces cannot be directly connected and require an adapter for conversion. If you are using a monitor with a VGA/DP interface, you can also use an adapter for display.
3. Use a power supply to power the board. Note: The specified power supply is the minimum requirement. If multiple peripherals are connected, use a power supply with the same voltage but higher power output.

**Note**: During the first boot after burning the image, the system will configure the machine. After one or two minutes of being powered on, the system will automatically reboot, and it will then run normally.
