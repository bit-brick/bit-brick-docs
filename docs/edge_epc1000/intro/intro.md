![alt text](./static/image.png)

The EPC1000 Edge Computing Box is a highly cost-effective edge computing device, designed based on the domestic Spacemit K1 RISC-V application processor. It integrates an octa-core RISC-V X60 AI CPU with a maximum frequency of 1.8GHz, the CPU integrates 2.0 Tops AI computing power, and supports 4K video encoding and decoding. It adopts a compact industrial design, integrated structure, small size, powerful functions, featuring high performance, low power consumption, and domestic advantages.

EPC1000 Edge Computing Box has rich functional interfaces, including dual gigabit Ethernet ports, 4 USB3.0, 1 3.5mm headphone jack, 2 isolated RS485, 2 isolated RS232, 4 isolated DI, 4 isolated DO, 1 isolated CAN, supports 4G/5G, supports Beidou navigation and positioning, supports Micro SD card expansion, supports NVMe SSD expansion. It can be connected to display devices via HDMI and MIPI DSI for video output; external cameras can be connected for face recognition, attribute detection, etc.

With rich interfaces and powerful functions, it can be widely used in industrial IoT edge control, smart transportation edge terminals, smart agriculture edge monitoring and control, security monitoring edge analysis nodes, vehicle-mounted mobile edge computing terminals, environmental monitoring and emergency terminals, as well as smart commercial display and edge interaction terminals.
