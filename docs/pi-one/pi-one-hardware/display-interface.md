# PI ONE DISPLAY

PI ONE supports HDMI and MIPI DSI interface for display.

## HDMI
![HDMI Connector Example](/img/pi-one/hardware/display-interface/hdmi.png)
PI ONE integrated HDMI connector (micro HDMI) on board, and it supports HDMI 2.0. Resolutions:
- 720 x 480p60
- 1280 x 720p60
- 1920 x 1080p60
- 1920 x 1080p120
- 3840 x 2160p30

You can connect any screen that supports HDMI, but the screen may not support micro HDMI, and most of the screens may support DP interface or HDMI type A. So you might need a cable like this:
