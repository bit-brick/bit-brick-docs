# Swap Partition
When the system's physical memory is insufficient, you can add a Debian swap virtual memory partition for use by currently running programs. For example, creating a 2G virtual memory:

- Create a swap file
```bash
cd /opt
mkdir swap
dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1024 count=2000000
## count represents the size, here it's 2G
```
- Convert the file to swap file
```bash
sudo mkswap swapfile
```
- Activate the swap file
```bash
swapon /opt/swapfile
Deactivate:
swapoff /opt/swapfile
```

To automatically mount after system boot, add it to the /etc/fstab file
`eg : /opt/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0`

Verify if it's working
```bash
root@linaro-alip:/opt# free -h
               total       used       free     shared buff/cache   available
Memory:     1.9Gi       390Mi       91Mi       75Mi       1.5Gi       1.4Gi
Swap:       1.9Gi         0B       1.9Gi
e =h
```
