## 1. HDMI

High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a fully digital video and audio transmission interface that can transmit uncompressed audio and video signals. HDMI can be used in set-top boxes, DVD players, personal computers, TVs, game consoles, integrated amplifiers, digital audio, and TV devices. HDMI can transmit both audio and video signals simultaneously, greatly simplifying the installation complexity of system wiring.

## 2. MIPI DSI

The MIPI Alliance, or Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance, is an open standard and specification initiated by the MIPI Alliance for mobile application processors. It was established in 2003 by companies such as ARM, TI, ST, and Nokia. The MIPI protocol is widely used in various embedded imaging devices, such as smartphones, VR, smart wearables, etc. DSI is a high-speed interface between the processor and the display module.

For detailed specifications of MIPI DSI, refer to:
