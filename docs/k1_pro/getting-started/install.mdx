### Flashing the Image in Loader Mode

Open the RKDevTool flashing tool and set the board to flashing mode.

1. Prepare a Type-C cable and a power cable. The Type-C cable is used for image flashing.
2. Connect one end of the Type-C cable to the OTG interface of the board and the other end to the USB interface of the computer. Then connect the power supply to the board.
3. Open the RKDevTool software and switch the ADB device to Rockusb.
4. If unsuccessful, repeat steps 2-3.

## Flashing the Image to an SD Card

Flashing the image to an SD card requires dedicated flashing software and a card reader.

### Installing SDDiskTool

Flashing the image to an SD card requires the SD_Firmware_Tool.exe flashing tool and the SDCardFormatter formatting tool.

**Note**: RK3576 must use SDDiskTool version v1.78 or above.

1. After installing SDCardFormatter, open the software. Once the SD card is detected, click "Format." If the card is not detected, use the built-in Windows formatting tool first, then use this tool.
2. Extract the SD_Firmware_Tool package. The tool can be used without installation. Double-click to enter the software interface.

### Flashing the Image

Open the executable file SD_Firmware_Tool.exe and insert the SD card.

1. First, select the correct SD card to be flashed. Then set the function mode to "SD Boot," select the image to be flashed, and finally click "Start" to create and flash the image to the SD card.
2. Wait patiently for the SD card to finish flashing. Larger images will take longer to flash.

## FAQs

**Q1**: What is the difference between MASKROM mode flashing and Loader mode flashing?

**A1**: The principle of Loader mode flashing is that the board detects a pin being pressed during the uboot startup phase and then enters flashing mode. Loader mode flashing requires the image to be intact (mostly used in Android mode). MASKROM mode flashing occurs when the chip detects the pin being pressed during startup and then enters flashing mode. MASKROM mode flashing is suitable for most scenarios.
