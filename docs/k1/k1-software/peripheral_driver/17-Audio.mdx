# Audio

Introduction to the functions and usage of Audio.

## Module Introduction

The Audio module includes 2 I2S and 1 HDMIAUDIO.

### Function Introduction

![](static/AUDIO.png)

The ALSA audio framework can be divided into the following layers:  

- ALSA Library  
Provides a unified API interface for applications. All APPs only need to call the API provided by alsa-lib to implement playback, recording, and control. There are currently two basic libraries, tinyalsa is a simplified alsa-lib library, mainly used by Android systems.
- ALSA CORE  
The core layer of ALSA, provides logical devices (PCM/CTL/MIDI/TIMER/…) system calls upward, and drives hardware devices (Machine/I2S/DMA/CODEC) downward.
- ASoC Core  
The standard framework of ALSA, the core part of ALSA-driver, provides general methods and data structures for various audio device drivers.
- Hardware driver  
Audio hardware device driver, composed of three main parts: Machine, Platform, Codec. Provides ALSA Driver API and the initialization and workflow of the corresponding audio device, implements specific functional components, which is the part that driver developers need to implement.
**Machine**: Generally refers to a specific board, containing specific peripherals, providing a carrier for CPU and Codec. The Machine driver is almost non-reusable. The Machine driver associates the Platform driver and Codec driver together, specifies which Platform driver to use, which Soc-side dai (digital audio interface) to use, which Codec driver to use, and which dai interface on the Codec to use through snd_soc_dai_link, and also performs some board-specific operations.
**Platform**: Generally refers to a specific SoC platform, which can be understood as a certain Soc, with I2S, AC97 audio interfaces, etc., and internally has clocks and DMA units for audio data transmission. The Platform driver is only related to a specific Soc, implements the audio DMA driver and Soc-side dai interface driver of the Soc, it is only related to the SoC, not the Machine, so we can abstract the Platform, so that the same Soc can be used in different Machines without any modification.
**Codec**: Audio codec, which includes I2S interface, D/A, A/D, Mixer, PA (amplifier), usually contains multiple inputs (Mic, Line-in, I2S, PCM) and multiple outputs (headphones, speakers, earpiece, Line-out), and the Soc can usually control the codec chip via I2C. The Codec driver is only related to the Codec codec driver, not the Soc and Machine. Like Platform, Codec should be implemented as a reusable component, and the same Codec can be used by different Machines.

### Audio Solution Introduction

K1 currently supports two audio sound card solutions  
Solution 1: HDMIAUDIO, supports playback  
Solution 2: I2S0 with an external Codec ES8326B via I2C, supports playback and recording

### Source Code Structure Introduction

I2S/HDMIAUDIO controller driver code is under sound/soc/spacemit:

```

#### I2S-Codec Sound Card Configuration

##### Codec Configuration

Take Codec ES8326B as an example for complete sound card configuration

###### Config Configuration

```

###### dts Configuration

- gpio  
Configure according to the actual hardware design. For example, on some K1 development boards, ES8326B uses gpio129 for headphone plug detection and gpio127 to control the board speaker.

```
        es8326: es8326@19{
                interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
                interrupts = <126 1>;                 # headphone plug detection
                spk-ctl-gpio = <&gpio 127 0>;         # board speaker control gpio
        };

```

###### dts Configuration Example

The complete configuration for Codec ES8236B is as follows:

```
        es8326: es8326@19{
                compatible = "everest,es8326";
                reg = <0x19>;
                #sound-dai-cells = <0>;
                interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
                interrupts = <126 1>;                 # headphone plug detection
                spk-ctl-gpio = <&gpio 127 0>;         # board speaker control gpio
                everest,mic1-src = [44];              # ADC source configuration
                everest,mic2-src = [66];
                status = "okay";
        };
```

###### mclk Configuration

The mclk of Codec ES8326B is provided by I2S0, configured in the sound card node sound_codec

```

&sound_codec {
        status = "okay";
        simple-audio-card,name = "snd-es8326";
        spacemit,mclk-fs = <64>;                      # configure mclk = 64 * fs, i.e. 3.072MHz
        simple-audio-card,codec {
                sound-dai = <&es8326>;
        };
};

```

Note: spacemit,mclk-fs only supports 64/128/256, i.e. 3.072/6.144/12.288MHz

##### Sound Card Configuration

###### dts Configuration

```
        sound_codec: snd-card@1 {
                compatible = "spacemit,simple-audio-card";
                simple-audio-card,format = "i2s";
                status = "disabled";
                interconnects = <&dram_range4>;
                interconnect-names = "dma-mem";
                spacemit,init-jack;
                simple-audio-card,cpu {                      # cpudai configuration
                        sound-dai = <&i2s0>;
                };
                simple-audio-card,plat {
                        sound-dai = <&i2s0_dma>;             # platform pcm configuration
                };
        };

&sound_codec {
        status = "okay";
        simple-audio-card,name = "snd-es8326";
        spacemit,mclk-fs = <64>;
        simple-audio-card,codec {
                sound-dai = <&es8326>;                       # codecdai configuration
        };
};
