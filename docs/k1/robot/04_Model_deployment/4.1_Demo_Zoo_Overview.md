# 4.1 Demo Zoo Overview

## Intro

The Bianbu AI Demo Zoo is a collection of sample projects independently developed by SpacemiT. It is designed to provide deployment references for a variety of deep learning models on the K1 series chips, demonstrating an **end-to-end** inference workflow.

This project offers two main branches: **Computer Vision** (CV) and **Natural Language Processing** (NLP). The CV branch covers typical tasks such as image classification, object detection, and face recognition. It supports both C++ and Python development languages and is suitable for a wide range of **real-world** **deployment** scenariosa.

For a detailed list of supported models, please see the  [ Model List](https://gitee.com/bianbu/spacemit-demo/blob/main/README.md#cv%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD).Currently, it covers common models such as classification networks (ResNet, MobileNet), detection networks (YOLOv5, YOLOX), and face recognition models (ArcFace).

## Demos

Most models provide inference samples in both Python and C++. After downloading the necessary model weights and test data according to the README.md file, users can complete the inference demonstration in just a few steps.

### Python Demo 

Taking ResNet image classification as an example:

```shell
cd python
python test_resnet.py  # Default to using the ResNet50 model.
```

After the model finishes running, it will output the predicted class labels. 

### C++ Demo 

```bash
cd cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
./resnet_demo --model /path/to/resnet50.onnx --image /path/to/image.jpg
```

After it's done running, the prediction results will also be output in the terminal. You can combine this with OpenCV to render the classification labels.
