## ROS 2 Functional Interfaces

Bianbu ROS provides high-level, modular ROS 2 interfaces abstracted for common robotics tasks, including:

- Visual and video-based AI inference (ONNX)
- Human-following modules
- ByteTrack multi-object tracking
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

- WebSocket-based visualization
- SLAM and autonomous navigation
- Acoustic source localization
- Hardware-accelerated video encode/decode nodes

## Runtime Environment

Multi-language runtime support is built in to support flexible development:

- Python
- Java
- Node.js
- Rust

## System Middleware

The middleware layer provides unified access to hardware resources and optimized data flows:

- USB camera capture
- MIPI camera interface
- V2D image processing module
- Hardware video encoding/decoding
- VO (video output) support
- DRM display rendering
- RTSP streaming (input/output)
- ONNX C API inference interface

## High-Performance Libraries

Optimized for AI workloads, multimedia processing, and vector acceleration:

- **Eigen** (with RISC-V Vector Extension - RVV support)
- **OpenCV** (RVV-enabled)
- **OpenVML** (vectorized math library with RVV)
- **OpenSSL** (hardware-accelerated)
- **MPP** (Multimedia Processing Platform with C APIs and samples)
- **Mesa 3D**
- **OpenGLES**

## Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is responsible for managing the processor and other hardware resources, providing an interface between user applications and hardware. Its main functions include interrupt and timer management, process management, memory management, file system management, device driver management, and network protocol stack support. The source code is open-sourced on Gitee.

## U-Boot (Bootloader)

U-Boot is a robust bootloader used to initialize hardware and load the Linux kernel, device tree, and initramfs from various media (e.g., SD card, eMMC, SPI Flash, SSD, or network).

- **Version**: 2022.10

## OpenSBI (Firmware Interface)

OpenSBI (Supervisor Binary Interface) is a runtime firmware layer for RISC-V processors that operates in machine mode (M-mode), providing system-level services to bootloaders, hypervisors, and OS kernels.

- **Version**: 1.3
