# Electron Usage Guide
Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Embedding Chromium and Node.js into the binary Electron allows you to maintain a JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux - without the need for local development experience.
## Preparation
Before using Electron, you need to install Node.js and NPM for it.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install npm
```
Check if the installation is successful.
```
npm -v
```
## Quick Start
1. Download `electron-quick-start`,
```
git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start.git ~/electron-quick-start
