# Peripheral Driver

Introduction to the purpose, scope, and relevant personnel of this documentation.

## Purpose

This document introduces the board-level configuration, CONFIG configuration, testing, debugging interfaces, and common issues for each interface and peripheral of the SpacemiT K1 CPU, to facilitate secondary development by developers.

## Scope

Applicable to SpacemiT K1 CPU.

## Relevant Personnel

- Driver Engineer
- System Engineer

## Function Introduction

Peripheral drivers (or device drivers) are the interface that controls hardware devices and the operating system. Linux system peripheral drivers are modular components that act as a bridge between hardware and the operating system, responsible for hardware initialization, configuration, management, data transfer, and error handling.

SpacemiT K1 includes a variety of rich IO capabilities, integrating multiple PCIe, USB, GMAC, SPI, and other interfaces, providing comprehensive peripheral connection options. This document contains usage instructions for high-speed expansion interface drivers, audio and video interface drivers, industrial expansion interface drivers, storage interface drivers, etc., involved in K1.

- High-speed expansion interface drivers: PCIe, USB, GMAC, etc.
- Audio and video interface drivers: DSI, HDMI, CSI, etc.
- Industrial expansion interface drivers: CAN-FD, UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, etc.
- Storage interface drivers: SDHC, SPI-Flash, etc.
