# 1. OpenHarmony Application Development Overview

## 1.1. ArkTS

ArkTS is the official primary application development language for the HarmonyOS/OpenHarmony ecosystem. It is an extension based on TypeScript (TS), a superset of TS, inheriting TypeScript syntax style, enhancing static type checking (compile-time error detection to improve code robustness), compatible with JS/TS ecosystem, supports efficient interoperability, and lowers migration barriers.

### 1.1.1. Core Technical Features

- Declarative UI development paradigm

  - Define components using decorators (such as `@Entry`, `@Component`) to build UI logic with concise declarative syntax
  - Provide state management (such as `@State`), automatically updating UI on data changes
- Distributed and concurrency enhancements

  - Optimized concurrent programming APIs, support multi-threaded task scheduling (such as Taskpool mechanism), improve cross-device collaboration performance
  - Provide underlying support for "develop once, deploy everywhere", adapting to all-scenario devices such as phones, tablets, and car systems
- Performance and stability optimization

  - Static type constraints reduce runtime type checks, improving execution efficiency
  - Enforce explicit initialization of properties (such as class member variables) to avoid runtime crashes caused by undefined errors

## 1.2. ArkUI

ArkUI (Ark UI Framework) is a declarative UI development framework built by Huawei for the HarmonyOS/OpenHarmony ecosystem, focusing on efficient, high-performance cross-device application UI development. Based on ArkTS language extension (TypeScript superset), it simplifies UI construction logic through componentization and state-driven mechanisms, provides minimal UI syntax (such as the `@Component` decorator), and allows developers to describe UI structure declaratively instead of imperative operations.

### 1.2.1. Core Technical Features

- High-performance rendering architecture

  - Optimized UI update mechanism: upgrades the Diff algorithm from tree structure comparison to single-node functional updates, greatly improving rendering efficiency
  - Unified rendering engine ensures smooth animations and reduces main thread stutter
- Decoupling logic and UI

  - Simplifies state management through two-way data binding, reducing cross-end development code by more than 40%
  - Supports state management (such as `@State`, `@Link`), enabling automatic UI refresh on data changes
- Polymorphic component library

  - Provides rich built-in components (text, buttons, lists, etc.) and layout capabilities, covering basic UI to complex interaction scenarios
  - Supports custom component development to meet business customization needs

## 1.3. Ark Runtime

Ark Runtime (also known as Ark Runtime) is the core engine in the HarmonyOS/OpenHarmony ecosystem that supports the execution of ArkTS/JS/TS languages, responsible for bytecode execution, memory management, and cross-language interoperability.

### 1.3.1. Core Architecture Components

- Core Subsystem

  - Provides basic runtime libraries, supports bytecode file parsing (File component), debugging toolchain (Tooling component), and system call adaptation (Base library)
- Execution Subsystem

  - Includes bytecode interpreter, inline cache optimization mechanism, and efficiently executes Ark bytecode (.abc files)
- Compiler Subsystem

  - Supports AOT (ahead-of-time optimization), JIT (dynamic compilation experimental stage), and IR-based compilation framework to improve code execution efficiency
- Runtime Subsystem

  - Memory management: CMS-GC garbage collector implements concurrent marking and partial memory compaction
  - Cross-language interface: supports multi-language hybrid development such as TS/JS/C++ via Node-API

### 1.3.2. Key Technical Features

- Multi-mode execution engine

  - Supports interpretation, AOT pre-compilation, and experimental JIT dynamic compilation, balancing startup speed and runtime efficiency
- High-performance memory management

  - Uses parallel marking CMS-GC algorithm to reduce pause time; supports partial memory compaction to optimize memory fragmentation
- Distributed debugging support

  - Built-in Debugger toolchain enables real-time diagnostics and performance analysis during cross-device collaborative development
- Standard library compatibility

  - Fully implements ECMAScript specification, provides efficient container libraries (such as Map/Set), ensuring JS/TS ecosystem compatibility

# 2. Development Environment Setup (Windows)

## 2.1. DevEco Studio Installation and Configuration

- Download tool: [Click to Download DevEcoStudio5.0.5.310](https://archive.spacemit.com/tools/openharmony/devecostudio-windows-5.0.5.310.zip)
- Double-click the downloaded `deveco-studio-xxxx.exe` to enter the DevEco Studio installation wizard. By default, it installs to `C:\Program Files`, or you can install to a specified location (do not use Chinese or special characters), then click NEXT.

## 2.2. SDK Toolchain Configuration

### 2.2.1. Public SDK and Full SDK

In `OpenHarmony`, `Public SDK` and `Full SDK` are toolkits for different development scenarios. The core differences are as follows:

- API Permissions

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Type</td>
<td>Permission Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Public SDK</td>
<td>For general application developers, contains only open APIs, does not involve system-sensitive permissions (such as `@ohos.app.ability.abilityManager`, Bluetooth control, and other high-permission interfaces)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Full SDK</td>
<td>For OEMs and system application developers, contains all system-level APIs (including interfaces requiring high-permission calls)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

- Acquisition and Deployment

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Type</td>
<td>Acquisition Method</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Public SDK</td>
<td>Download in DevEco Studio, no extra steps required</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Full SDK</td>
<td>Must be downloaded separately (from OpenHarmony mirror site or by compiling source code), and replace the Public SDK</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

- Applicable Scenarios

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Scenario</td>
<td>Recommended SDK</td>
<td>Reason</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>General third-party application development</td>
<td>Public SDK</td>
<td>Meets basic functional needs, avoids risk of permission abuse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>System-level applications (such as Launcher)</td>
<td>Full SDK</td>
<td>Requires high-permission interfaces for system management, hardware control, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Functions relying on non-open APIs</td>
<td>Full SDK</td>
<td>Such as using `mediaLibrary` for advanced media processing or customizing system services</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### 2.2.2. Download Public SDK

`DevEco Studio` provides an out-of-the-box development experience, integrating `HarmonyOS SDK`, `Node.js`, `Hvigor`, `OHPM`, emulator platform, etc., simplifying the installation and configuration process.

`HarmonyOS SDK` is embedded in `DevEco Studio`, no extra download or configuration is needed. However, the `OpenHarmony` SDK is not integrated. For OpenHarmony application development, go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `OpenHarmony SDK` tab to download the `OpenHarmony SDK`.

![](https://developer.spacemit.com/resource/file/images?fileName=DGPfbGjSTob8xjx2Hz9cUJjNnjh.png)

In the figure above, three SDKs for `API10/API11/API12` are downloaded and saved in the path `Z:\workspace\ohsdk`

### 2.2.3. Replace Full SDK

- Download the Full SDK for K1 OH5.0, [Click to Download](https://archive.spacemit.com/tools/openharmony/sdk/12/). Currently, K1 OH5.0 only supports API12. The system supports windows/macos/ubuntu, download according to your development machine.
- After downloading the Full SDK, extract it and replace the corresponding directory in the Public SDK.

## 2.3. Real Device Debugging

After successfully connecting the development device via hdc, the connected device and some run/debug buttons will be displayed in the upper right corner of Deveco Studio.

## 3.3. Page Development

Click `entry` -> `src` -> `main` -> `ets` -> `pages`, open the `Index.ets` file, and write the page.

## 3.4. Modify build-profile.json5

In the `build-profile.json5` at the root of the application, change

```json
"products": [
  {
    "name": "default",
    "signingConfig": "default",
    "compatibleSdkVersion": "5.0.0(12)",
    "runtimeOS": "HarmonyOS",

      "strictMode": {
        "caseSensitiveCheck": true,
        "useNormalizedOHMUrl": true
      }
    }
  }
],
```

to

```json
"products": [
  {
    "name": "default",
    "signingConfig": "default",
    "compileSdkVersion": 12,
    "compatibleSdkVersion": 12,
    "runtimeOS": "OpenHarmony"

# 4. System Application Build and Installation

Take launcher as an example to explain the process of building and installing a system application.

Note: Building system applications requires the Full SDK.

## 4.1. Open Application Project

Copy `applications/standard/launcher` to the D drive. The directory should not contain Chinese characters, otherwise there may be problems. In Deveco Studio, click File -> Open, select the launcher folder to open.

## 4.2. Build

Click `Build` -> `Build Hap(s)/APP(s)` -> `Build Hap(s)` to build. If the following output appears in Build Output, the build is successful.

```
> hvigor Finished :pad_launcher:assembleHap... after 1 ms 
> hvigor Finished :phone_launcher:default@SignHap... after 3 s 484 ms 
> hvigor Finished :phone_launcher:assembleHap... after 1 ms 
> hvigor BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4 min 16 s 555 ms 

Process finished with exit code 0

Build Analyzer results available
```

After the launcher is built, 2 hap files will be generated: `launcher\product\phone\build\default\outputs\default\phone_launcher-default-signed.hap` and `launcher\feature\settings\build\default\outputs\default\launcher_settings-phone_launcher-default-signed.hap`

## 4.3. Installation

System applications cannot be installed directly by clicking the install button like non-system applications. A series of operations are required. You can write a script for one-click installation as follows:

```bash
hdc shell mount -o rw,remount /
hdc shell rm -rf /system/app/com.ohos.launcher/*
hdc shell rm -rf /data/*
hdc file send D:\HAP_CODE\launcher\product\phone\build\default\outputs\default\phone_launcher-default-signed.hap /system/app/com.ohos.launcher/Launcher.hap
hdc file send D:\HAP_CODE\launcher\feature\settings\build\default\outputs\default\launcher_settings-phone_launcher-default-signed.hap /system/app/com.ohos.launcher/Launcher_Settings.hap
hdc shell rm -rf /data/*
hdc shell sync /system/bin/udevadm trigger

pause

hdc shell reboot
```

# 5. System Signature

How to grant system permissions to a normal application? That is to use the Full SDK for system signing. The process of system signing is introduced below.

## 5.1. Introduction to Signing Tools

The path of the signing tool is `ohsdk\12\toolchains\lib`, as follows:

```
fuqiang@snode1:~/workspace/ohsdk/12/toolchains/lib$ tree
.
├── app_check_tool.jar
├── app_packing_tool.jar
├── app_unpacking_tool.jar
├── hap-sign-tool.jar
├── OpenHarmony.p12
├── OpenHarmonyProfileDebug.pem
├── OpenHarmonyProfileRelease.pem
├── UnsgnedDebugProfileTemplate.json
└── UnsgnedReleasedProfileTemplate.json

0 directories, 9 files
```

## 5.2. Modify Configuration

Modify the application package name, permissions, and application type in `UnsgnedDebugProfileTemplate.json` and `UnsgnedReleasedProfileTemplate.json` as follows:

```json
"bundle-name":"com.example.myapplication",
"apl":"normal",
"app-feature":"hos_normal_app"
```

Change to:

```json
"bundle-name":"com.example.myapplication",
"apl":"system_core",
"app-feature":"hos_system_app"
```

## 5.3. Generate p12

```json
java -jar hap-sign-tool.jar generate-keypair -keyAlias "ohos-app" -keyAlg "ECC"  -keySize "NIST-P-256" -keystoreFile "app.p12" -keyPwd "ohos123456" -keystorePwd "ohos123456"
```

## 5.4. Generate csr

```json
java -jar hap-sign-tool.jar generate-csr -keyAlias "ohos-app" -keyPwd "ohos123456" -subject "C=CN,O=OpenHarmony,OU=OpenHarmony Team,CN=OpenHarmony Application Release" -signAlg "SHA256withRSA" -keystoreFile "app.p12" -keystorePwd "ohos123456" -outFile "app.csr"
```

## 5.5. Generate cer

```
keytool -gencert -alias "OpenHarmony Application CA" -infile app.csr -outfile app-release.cer -keystore OpenHarmony.p12 -sigalg SHA384withECDSA -storepass 123456 -ext KeyUsage:“critical=digitalSignature” -validity 36500 -rfc
```

## 5.6. Generate p7b

```json
java -jar hap-sign-tool.jar sign-profile -keyAlias "openharmony application profile release" -signAlg "SHA256withECDSA" -mode "localSign" -profileCertFile "OpenHarmonyProfileRelease.pem" -inFile "UnsgnedReleasedProfileTemplate.json" -keystoreFile "OpenHarmony.p12" -outFile "app-release-profile.p7b" -keyPwd "123456" -keystorePwd "123456"
```

## 5.7. Configure Signing in Deveco Studio

```
Store file(*.p12):    app.12
keyAlias:             ohos-app
Store Password:       ohos123456
key Password:         ohos123456
Profile file(*.p7b):  app-release-profile.p7b
Certpath file(*.cer): app-release.cer
```

# 6. FAQ

## 6.1. What is the difference between application and atomic service when creating a new project in Deveco Studio?

When creating a new project in DevEco Studio, Application (normal application) and Atomic Service (atomic service) are two different project types. The core differences are as follows:

### Functional Positioning and Entry Form

Typical scenarios:

- Weather forecast card (Atomic Service) can display information without installation
- Shopping application (Application) requires user installation and active opening

### Project Structure and Deployment

Key configuration differences:

- Atomic Service needs to declare `abilities.formEnabled: true` in `module.json5` to support card form
- If you mistakenly select Atomic Service but need a desktop icon, modify `installationFree: false` in `config.json`

### Development Restrictions and Compatibility

### Applicable Scenario Summary

- Choose Application:
  Applications that require independent installation and complete interaction (such as games, social software)
- Choose Atomic Service:
  Scenario-based services that do not require installation (such as express cards, smart home control cards)

## 6.2. Signature error when installing application

Error:

```
Install Failed: error: failed to install bundle.
code:9568393
error: verify code signature failed.
The target device does not work with apps with an OpenHarmony signature. Sign the app with a HarmonyOS signature before installing it on the device.
Open signing configs
06/10 19:21:15:585: $ hdc shell rm -rf data/local/tmp/23b3eb890bb24bfb9d7ec34993386a6a
06/10 19:21:15:586: Launch com.example.myapplication failed, starting handle failure progress
Error while Deploy Hap
```

Solution:

- In the `build-profile.json5` at the root of the application, change

```json
"products": [
  {
    "name": "default",
    "signingConfig": "default",
    "compatibleSdkVersion": "5.0.0(12)",
    "runtimeOS": "HarmonyOS",
    "buildOption": {
      "strictMode": {
        "caseSensitiveCheck": true,
        "useNormalizedOHMUrl": true
      }
    }
  }
],
```

to

```json
"products": [
  {
    "name": "default",
    "signingConfig": "default",
    "compileSdkVersion": 12,
    "compatibleSdkVersion": 12,
    "runtimeOS": "OpenHarmony"
  }
],
```

- Go to the signing settings page, check `Automatically generate signature`, do not check `Support HarmonyOS`, then click `Apply` and `OK`.
