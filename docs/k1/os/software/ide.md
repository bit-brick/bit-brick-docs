   Exec=/opt/vscodium/bin/codium
   Terminal=false
   Icon=/opt/vscodium/resources/app/resources/linux/code.png

   ```

   Note, the installation path from the Bianbu repository is `/usr/share/codium`, please replace `/opt/vscodium` above.

### Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH

Not supported yet.

## VS Code in the browser

Deploy [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) to use VS Code remotely in a browser.

Install `code-server` on Bianbu v2.0rc1 or later：

```shell
sudo apt-get install code-server
```

Run `code-server`，replacing `IP` with your machine's IP address:

```shell
code-server --host IP --port PORT
```

Note that if `IP` is not specified, it defaults to localhost and can only be accessed from the local browser. `PORT`  is usually optional. When you see the following information, it means `code-server` has started successfully.

```
info HTTP server listening on http://IP:PORT/
info  Session server listening on ~/.local/share/code-server/code-server-ipc.sock
```

Open a browser on any computer or tablet and visit `http://IP:PORT` to open remote folders and files.
