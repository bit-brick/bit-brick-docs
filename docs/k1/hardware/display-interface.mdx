## 1. HDMI
The High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI [1]) is a fully digital video and audio transmission interface that can transmit uncompressed audio and video signals. HDMI can be used in set-top boxes, DVD players, personal computers, televisions, game consoles, integrated amplifiers, digital audio systems, and televisions, etc. HDMI can transmit audio and video signals simultaneously, and since the audio and video signals use the same cable, it greatly simplifies the installation difficulty of the system circuit.

You can directly connect K1 and the display using a standard HDMI cable (if the display interface is not HDMI, you can purchase an HDMI converter, such as HDMI to DP, etc.)

## 2. MIPI DSI
The MIPI Alliance, namely the Mobile Industry Processor Interface (MIPI for short) Alliance. MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) is an open standard and specification formulated by the MIPI Alliance for mobile application processors. It is an alliance founded by companies such as ARM, TI, ST, Nokia, etc. in 2003. The MIPI protocol is widely used in various embedded image devices, such as smartphones, VR, smart wearable devices, etc. DSI is a high-speed interface between the processor and the display module.
For the detailed specifications of MIPI DSI, refer to:
[MIPI DSI Specifications](https://www.mipi.org/specifications/dsi)

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Figure 3 On-board MIPI DSI Interface of K1</div>
The K1 motherboard integrates a display interface supporting MIPI DSI to support screen display. Its features are as follows:
- Support MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI) standard
- Support MIPI DPHY up to 4 data lanes, up to 1200Mbps
- Support 1 active panel in 1 DPHY link
- Support Display Command Set (DCS) standard
- Support all pixel formats defined in DSI and DCS
- Support video burst mode with DPHY up to 1.2Ghz per lane
- Support virtual channel in MIPI Link
- Support up to 1080p resolution
- Support command, video, and burst modes
- Support HS-TX, LP-TX, LP-RX, and LP-CD
## 3. Pin Definition of DSI
The pin definition of DSI is as follows:

As can be seen from the above figure, the display interface also adds the functions of I2C and control pins, which are mainly used for touch screen control. This will be described in the software part on how to use this interface to add the touch screen function to the system.
K1 defaults to supporting the 10.1-inch display developed by BIT-BRICK. If you need to support other displays, you can connect the corresponding signals according to the interface definition, and then modify the configuration file of the screen according to the specification.
