# CPUFREQ

Introduction to the functions and usage of CPUFREQ.

## Module Introduction

The CPUFREQ subsystem is responsible for adjusting the CPU frequency and voltage at runtime, aiming to minimize CPU power consumption while meeting performance requirements.

### Function Introduction

![](static/cpufreq.png)

1. cpufreq core is the core module of the cpufreq framework, mainly implementing three types of functions:  
    1.1 Abstracts the common logic interface for frequency and voltage scaling  
    1.2 Provides a unified interface to user space via sysfs, and notifies other drivers of frequency changes via notifier
    1.3 Provides a driver framework for CPU frequency and voltage control  
2. cpufreq governor is responsible for various frequency and voltage scaling policies  
3. cpufreq driver implements platform-specific frequency and voltage scaling mechanisms
4. cpufreq stats is responsible for frequency information and statistics of each frequency point, providing cpufreq-related statistics for each CPU

Test method

```
1. Change the policy to userspace mode
echo userspace > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor

2. View the list of supported frequencies
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_available_frequencies
614400 819000 1000000 1228800 1600000

3. Set the CPU frequency
echo 1228800 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_setspeed

4. Check if the frequency is set successfully
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_cur_freq

```

## Configuration Introduction

Mainly includes driver enable configuration and dts configuration

### CONFIG Configuration

CPUFREQ configuration is as follows:

```
CONFIG_SPACEMIT_K1X_CPUFREQ:

 This adds the CPUFreq driver support for Freescale QorIQ SoCs
 which are capable of changing the CPU's frequency dynamically.
 
 Symbol: SPACEMIT_K1X_CPUFREQ [=y]
 Type  : tristate
 Defined at drivers/cpufreq/Kconfig:315
 Prompt: CPU frequency scaling driver for Spacemit K1X
 Depends on: CPU_FREQ [=y] && OF [=y] && COMMON_CLK [=y]
 Location:
  -> CPU Power Management
   -> CPU Frequency scaling
    -> CPU Frequency scaling (CPU_FREQ [=y])
     -> CPU frequency scaling driver for Spacemit K1X (SPACEMIT_K1X_CPUFREQ [=y])
 Selects: CPUFREQ_DT [=y] && CPUFREQ_DT_PLATDEV [=y]    
```

### dts Configuration

```
Due to the large size of the dts configuration, please refer to the file:
