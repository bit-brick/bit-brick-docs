3. Connect one end of the Type-C cable to the board's OTG port, hold down the K1 Pro's Download button, then connect the power supply to K1 Pro to enter Loader mode

## Flashing the Image to an SD Card

Flashing the image to an SD card requires dedicated flashing software and a card reader.

### Installing SDDiskTool

</span>

**Note**: RK3576 must use SDDiskTool version v1.78 or above.

1. After installing SDCardFormatter, open the software. Once the SD card is detected, click "Format." If the card is not detected, use the built-in Windows formatting tool first, then use this tool.
2. Extract the SD_Firmware_Tool package. The tool can be used without installation. Double-click to enter the software interface.

### Flashing the Image

Open the executable file SD_Firmware_Tool.exe and insert the SD card.

1. First, select the correct SD card to be flashed. Then set the function mode to "SD Boot," select the image to be flashed, and finally click "Start" to create and flash the image to the SD card.
2. Wait patiently for the SD card to finish flashing. Larger images will take longer to flash.

## FAQs

**Q1**: What is the difference between MASKROM mode flashing and Loader mode flashing?

**A1**: The principle of Loader mode flashing is that the board detects a pin being pressed during the uboot startup phase and then enters flashing mode. Loader mode flashing requires the image to be intact (mostly used in Android mode). MASKROM mode flashing occurs when the chip detects the pin being pressed during startup and then enters flashing mode. MASKROM mode flashing is suitable for most scenarios.
