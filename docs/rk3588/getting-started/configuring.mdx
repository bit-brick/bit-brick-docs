# Boot and Configuration

### Boot Methods

SSOM-3588 supports booting from SD card and eMMC

- If there is an image on the SD card, the system will boot from the SD card first
- If there is no image on the SD card but there is an image on the eMMC, the system will boot from the eMMC image
- If neither the SD card nor the eMMC has an image, the system will not boot

### Boot Notes

After burning the Linux system image to the SD card or eMMC, the board will automatically run when powered on.

#### Boot Precautions:

1. Properly connect all peripherals on the board and use the provided screws to secure them, especially for devices that do not support hot-plugging (MIPI display, MIPI camera, wireless module, hard disk, etc.). Plugging or unplugging these devices while the board is powered on may damage the device and cause it to malfunction.

2. When using a display, note that the MIPI screen interface does not support hot-plugging. The HDMI interface comes in two forms: standard HDMI and Micro-HDMI. These two interfaces cannot be directly connected and require an adapter for conversion. If you are using a VGA/DP monitor, you can also use an adapter for display.
3. Use the power supply to power the board. Note: The labeled power specification is the minimum requirement. If you connect more peripherals, please use a power supply with the same voltage but higher power.

**Note**: The first boot after burning the image will configure the machine. The system will automatically reboot after one or two minutes of power-on, after which the system will run normally.
